;   MilliForth for 6502

;
;   SectorForth and MilliForth was made for x86 arch 
;   and uses full 16-bit registers 
;
;   The way at 6502 is use a page zero and lots of lda/sta bytes
;
;   Focus in size not performance.
;
;   Changes:
;
;   all data (36 cells) and return (36 cells) stacks, PAD (16 cells)
;       and TIB (80 bytes) are in same page $200, 256 bytes; 
;
;   TIB and PAD grows forward, stacks grows backwards;
;
;   no overflow or underflow checks;
;
;   the header order is LINK, SIZE+FLAG, NAME.
;
;   only IMMEDIATE flag used as $80, no hide, no compile, no extras;
;
;   As Forth-1994: FALSE is $0000 ; TRUE  is $FFFF ;
;
;   Remarks:
;
;       if PAD not used, data stack could be 52 cells; 
;
;       words must be between spaces, before and after, must;
;
;       no line wrap then use a maximum of 72 bytes of tib;
;
;       no need 'pad' at end of even names;
;
;   For 6502:
;
;       is a 8-bit processor with 16-bit address space;
;
;       in address space, most significant byte is the page count;
;
;       page zero and page one hardware reserved;
;
;       hardware stack not used for this Forth;
