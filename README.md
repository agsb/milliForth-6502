# milliForth for 6502

_"A Forth in 380 bytes â€” the smallest real programming language ever, as of yet."_

The milliForth[^1] is very similar to sectorForth[^2], and smaller than sector Lisp[^3]

## bytes?

Yes, bytes. But the code is for a x86 CPU. 

How minimal could be it for a classic 6502 CPU ?

Two essentially different CPUs, a 16-bit x86 based on complex registers and opcodes, and a 8-bit 6502 using page zero as registers and page one as hardware stack.

## Coding

This version includes: 
```
        primitives:
            sp@, rp@, s@, +, nand, @, !, :, ;, 0=, key, emit, 2/,

        internals: 
            spush, spull, rpull, rpush, incr, decr, add, etc (register mimics)
            unnest, next, nest, link, jump, (inner interpreter) 
            quit, token, skip, scan, newline, find, compile, execute, exit (outer interpreter)
            _getchar_, _putchar_ (depends on system, used minimal for emulator )
```
    
### Coding for minimal size, not for best performance. Using ca65 V2.19 - Git 7979f8a41.

## Language

_"SectorFORTH was an extensive guide throughout the process of implementing milliFORTH, and milliFORTH's design actually converged on sectorFORTH unintentionally in a few areas. That said, the language implemented is intentionally very similar, being the 'minimal FORTH'."_

For Forth language primer see [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/)

The milliForth for 6502 have some changes:

- does not use _hardware stack_ as Forth stack;
- only _IMMEDIATE_ flag used;
- only update _latest_ at end of word definition, so the word is hidden while defined;
- redefine a word does not changes at previous uses;
- uses _Minimal Thread Indirect Code_ as inner dispatcher[^4];
- the _tib, locals, data stack, return stack_ at same page ($200) [^5];
- uses 32 bytes of _page zero_;
- depends on spaces before and after a word in tib;
- uses 7-bit ASCII characters;

- still no include a _'OK'_ or _'??'_;
- still no include a backspace routine for \b; 
- still no include a empty line routine for \u; 

### Memory

```
    $000    page zero       ; cpu reserved
    $100    hardware stack  ; cpu reserved
    $200    TIB             ; terminal input buffer, 80 bytes
    $250    Locals          ; reserved for locals, 16 cells
    $2DC    data stack      ; data stack, 36 cells
    $2FF    return stack    ; return stack, 36 cells
    $300    _main_          ; start of Forth
    $500    _init_          ; start of compose dictionary
```

## Use

_** Still not operational, using lib6502 for emulation and tests, Any sugestions ? **_

A crude small script for compile with ca65 is included.

    ; for make it
    sh mk a sector-6502

    ; for clear it
    sh mk x sector-6502

the size is take from main: to ends: using the sector-6502.lbl file

## Note

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliFort[^1]
