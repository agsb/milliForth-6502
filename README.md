# milliForth for 6502

_"A Forth in 380 bytes â€” the smallest real programming language ever, as of yet."_

The milliForth[^1] is very similar to sectorForth[^2], and smaller than sector Lisp[^3]

## bytes?

Yes, bytes. But the code is for a x86 CPU. 

How minimal could be it for a classic 6502 CPU ?

Two essentially different CPUs, a 16-bit x86 based on complex registers and opcodes, and a 8-bit 6502 using page zero as registers and page one as hardware stack.

## Coding

This version includes: 
```
        primitives:
            sp@, rp@, s@, +, nand, @, !, :, ;, 0=, key, emit, 2/,

        internals: 
            spush, spull, rpull, rpush, incr, decr, add, etc (register mimics)
            unnest, next, nest, link, jump, (inner interpreter) 
            quit, token, skip, scan, newline, find, compile, execute, exit (outer interpreter)
            _getchar_, _putchar_ (depends on system, used minimal for emulator )
```

### Coding for minimal size, not for best performance. Using ca65 V2.19 - Git 7979f8a41.

_09/01/2024_ code for 6502 sized to 654 bytes, stack goes forward, still crashes.

_02/01/2024_ code for 6502 sized to 647 bytes, still crashes by wrong jsr/jmp.

_19/12/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 629 bytes, include key and emit, clean wrong rts.

_05/12/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 588 bytes, include names in ascii-7 and aritmetic shift right (2/).

_27/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 572 bytes, clear some errors and ascii-7 checks

_14/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 624 bytes, no ascii-7, no key, no emit, no 2/, many errors

## Language

_"SectorFORTH was an extensive guide throughout the process of implementing milliFORTH, and milliFORTH's design actually converged on sectorFORTH unintentionally in a few areas. That said, the language implemented is intentionally very similar, being the 'minimal FORTH'."_

For Forth language primer see [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/)

The milliForth for 6502 have some changes:

- Does not use _hardware stack_ as Forth stack;
- Only _IMMEDIATE_ flag used;
- Only update _latest_ at end of word definition, so the word is hidden while defined;
- Uses _Minimal Thread Indirect Code_ as inner dispatcher[^4];
- sizes of _tib, data stack, return stack_ are 256 bytes [^5], code start at
  $500 bytes;
- uses 32 bytes of _page zero_;
- depends on spaces before and after a word in tib;
- uses 7-bit ASCII characters;
- still no include a _'OK '_;
- still no include a backspace routine; 

## Use

_** Still not operational, using lib6502 for emulation and tests, Any sugestions ? **_

A crude small script for compile with ca65 is included.

    ; for make it
    sh mk a sector-6502

    ; for clear it
    sh mk x sector-6502

the size is take from main: to ends: using the sector-6502.lbl file

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliFort[^1]
