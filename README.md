# A milliForth for 6502

_"A Forth in 340 bytes â€” the smallest real programming 
language ever, as of yet."_

The milliForth[^1] is a review of sectorForth[^2], 
and smaller than sector Lisp[^3]

The miniForth[^4] is another Forth to use in a boot sector 
of less than 512 bytes.

## Bytes?

Yes, bytes. But those are for a x86 16-bit CPU. 

How minimal could be it for a classic 6502 8-bit CPU ?

Two essentially different CPUs, a 16-bit x86 based on complex 
registers and opcodes, and a 8-bit 6502 using page zero 
as registers and page one as hardware stack.

## Inner Interpreter

The FIG-Forth (1980) for 6502 uses Indirect Thread Code (ITC) 
    as inner interpreter. 

The miniForth, sectorforth and milliForth use Direct Thread Code (DTC) 

This Forth for 6502, will be done using two models: 
    
    with classic Direct Thread Code ~ now with 640 bytes
    and
    with Minimal Thread Code (MTC) ~ now with 623 bytes

(later we will compare both, but DTC will win for less size) 

This project is also used to test variations of Minimum Thread Code
against a standart Direct Thread Code.

## Coding for 6502

Focus in size not performance.

Using ca65 V2.19 - Git 7979f8a41. 

The way at 6502 is use a page zero and lots of lda/sta bytes.

### Changes:

- as Forth-1994[^5]: FALSE is $0000 and TRUE is $FFFF ;
- all tib (80 bytes), pic (16 cells), data (36 cells) and 
    return (36 cells) stacks are in page $200 ; 
- tib and pic grows forward, stacks grows backwards ;
- no overflow or underflow checks ;
- only immediate flag used as $80, no more flags ;

### Remarks:

- 6502 is a byte processor, no need 'pad' at end of even names;
- hardware stack (page $100) not used as forth stack, free for use;
- uses 32 bytes of _page zero_;
- no multiuser, no multitask, no faster;
- only update _latest_ at end of word definition; 
- redefine a word does not change previous uses;
- stacks moves like the hardware stack;
- words must be between spaces, before and after ever ;
- uses 7-bit ASCII characters;
- approuch as ANSI X3.215-1994[^5]

11/08/2024:
    return to direct thread code:

11/06/2024:
    adapt for minimal thread indirect code

24/01/2024:
    write using standart direct thread code

## Coding

This version includes: 
```
primitives:
    s@, +, nand, @, !, :, ;, 0#, key, emit, exit,
    
    the sp@ and rp@ are derived from s@ in the my_hello_world.FORTH

internals: 
    spush, spull, rpull, rpush, (stack code)
    copyfrom, copyinto, (heap code)
    incr, decr, add, etc (register mimics)
    unnest, next, nest, (dtc inner) 
    * pick, jump, (mtc inner) 
    cold, quit, token, skip, scan, getline, (boot and terminal)
    parse, find, compile, execute, (outer interpreter)
    getch, putch, byes (depends on system, used minimal for emulator )

A my_hello_world.FORTH alternate version with dictionary for use;

```

### Memory

```
    $000    page zero       ; cpu reserved
    $100    hardware stack  ; cpu reserved
    $200    TIB             ; terminal input buffer, 80 bytes
    $298*   data stack      ; data stack, 36 cells, backwards
    $2E0*   return stack    ; return stack, 36 cells, backwards
    $2E0    PIC             ; reserved for scratch, 16 cells
    $300    _main_          ; start of Forth
    $???    _init_          ; start of compose dictionary
```

### Stacks

   " When heap moves forward, move the stack backward "

   Push is 'store and decrease'. Pull is 'increas and fetch'.

   A common memory model organization of Forth: 

   tib->...<-spt, user forth dictionary, here->pad...<-rpt,

   then backward stacks allow to use the slack space ... 

   This 6502 Forth memory model is blocked in pages of 256 bytes:

   page0, page1, page2, core ... forth dictionary ...here...
   
   at page2, without 'rush over'

   [tib 40 cells> <spt 36 cells| <rpt 36 cells|pic 16 cells> ] .

## Language

_"SectorFORTH was an extensive guide throughout the process of 
implementing milliFORTH, and milliFORTH's design actually converged
on sectorFORTH unintentionally in a few areas. That said, the language
implemented is intentionally very similar, being the 'minimal FORTH'."_

For Forth language primer see 
[Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/)

For Forth from inside howto see
[JonasForth](http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob_plain;f=jonesforth.S;hb=refs/heads/master)

## Use

_** 12/08/2024 DTC model operational, using lib6502 for emulation and tests **_

A crude small script for compile with ca65 is included.

    ; for make it
    sh mk a sector-6502

    ; for clear it
    sh mk x sector-6502

the size is take from main: to ends: using the sector-6502.lbl file

## Note

the originals files are edited for lines with less than 80 bytes

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliFort[^1]
