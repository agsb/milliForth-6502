# A milliForth for 6502

_"A Forth in 336 bytes â€” the smallest real programming 
language ever, as of yet."_

The milliForth[^1] is very similar to sectorForth[^2], 
and smaller than sector Lisp[^3]

The miniForth[^4] is another Forth to use in a boot sector 
of less than 512 bytes.

## Bytes?

Yes, bytes. But the code is for a x86 CPU. 

How minimal could be it for a classic 6502 CPU ?

Two essentially different CPUs, a 16-bit x86 based on complex 
registers and opcodes, and a 8-bit 6502 using page zero 
as registers and page one as hardware stack.

(Still in development)

## Inner Interpreter

As inner interpreter,

the miniForth and milliForth use Direct Thread Code (DTC) 

the FIG-Forth for 6502 uses Indirect Thread Code (ITC) 

This Forth for 6502, will be done using two models: 
    
    with classic DTC and with Minimal Indirect Thread Code (MITC)

(later we will compare both, but DTC will win in less size) 

## Coding for 6502

Using ca65 V2.19 - Git 7979f8a41. Focus in size not performance.

The way at 6502 is use a page zero and lots of lda/sta bytes.

### Changes:

- as Forth-1994[^5]: FALSE is $0000 and TRUE is $FFFF ;
- all tib (80 bytes), pic (16 cells), data (36 cells) and 
    return (36 cells) stacks are in page $200 ; 
- tib and pic grows forward, stacks grows backwards ;
- no overflow or underflow checks ;
- only immediate flag used as $80, no extras flags ;

### Remarks:

- 6502 is a byte processor, no need 'pad' at end of even names;
- hardware stack (page $100) not used as forth stack, free for use;
- no multiuser, no multitask, no faster;
- uses 32 bytes of _page zero_;
- only update _latest_ at end of word definition, 
    so the word is hidden while defined;
- redefine a word does not change previous uses;
- stacks moves like the hardware stack;
- words must be between spaces, before and after is wise;
- uses 7-bit ASCII characters;
- approuch as ANSI X3.215-1994[^5]

### Notes

Look up at Notes[^6]

11/06/2024:
    return to minimal thread indirect code
    using Minimal Thread Indirect Code_ as inner dispatcher[^7];

24/01/2024:
    for comparison with x86 code, 
    rewrite using standart direct thread code as inner dispatcher;

## Coding

This version includes: 
```
primitives:
    sp@, rp@, s@, +, nand, @, !, :, ;, 0#, key, emit, 2/, exit,

internals: 
    spush, spull, rpull, rpush, (stack code)
    copyfrom, copyinto, (heap code)
    incr, decr, add, etc (register mimics)
    unnest, next, nest, pick, link, jump, (inner interpreter) 
    cold, quit, token, skip, scan, getline, (boot and terminal)
    parse, find, compile, execute, exit (outer interpreter)
    getch, putch (depends on system, used minimal for emulator )
    
Order in dictionary:
    
    exit : ; sp@ rp@ s@ @ ! 0# nand + asr emit key

```

### Memory

```
    $000    page zero       ; cpu reserved
    $100    hardware stack  ; cpu reserved
    $200    TIB             ; terminal input buffer, 80 bytes
    $298*   data stack      ; data stack, 36 cells, backwards
    $2E0*   return stack    ; return stack, 36 cells, backwards
    $2E0    PIC             ; reserved for scratch, 16 cells
    $300    _main_          ; start of Forth
    $???    _init_          ; start of compose dictionary
```

### Stacks

   " When heap moves forward, move the stack backward "

   Push is 'store and decrease'. Pull is 'increas and fetch'.

   A common memory model organization of Forth: 

   tib->...<-spt, user forth dictionary, here->pad...<-rpt,

   then backward stacks allow to use the slack space ... 

   This 6502 Forth memory model is blocked in pages of 256 bytes:

   page0, page1, page2, core ... forth dictionary ...here...
   
   at page2, without 'rush over'

   [tib 40 cells> <spt 36 cells| <rpt 36 cells|pic 16 cells> ] .

## Language

_"SectorFORTH was an extensive guide throughout the process of 
implementing milliFORTH, and milliFORTH's design actually converged
on sectorFORTH unintentionally in a few areas. That said, the language
implemented is intentionally very similar, being the 'minimal FORTH'."_

For Forth language primer see 
[Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/)

## Use

_** Still not operational, using lib6502 for emulation and tests, Any sugestions ? **_

A crude small script for compile with ca65 is included.

    ; for make it
    sh mk a sector-6502

    ; for clear it
    sh mk x sector-6502

the size is take from main: to ends: using the sector-6502.lbl file

## Note

the originals files are edited for lines with less than 80 bytes

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliFort[^1]
