# milliForth for 6502

_"A Forth in 380 bytes â€” the smallest real programming language ever, as of yet."_

The milliForth[^1] is very similar to sectorForth[^2], and smaller than sector Lisp[^3]

## bytes?

Yes, bytes. But the code is for a x86 CPU. 

How minimal could be it for a classic 6502 CPU ?

Two essentially different CPUs, a 16-bit x86 based on complex registers and opcodes, and a 8-bit 6502 using page zero as registers and page one as hardware stack.

## Coding

This version includes: 
```
        primitives:
            @sp, @rp, s@, +, nand, @, !, :, ;, 0#, 2/,

        internals: 
            spush, spull, rpull, rpush, incr, decr, add, etc (register mimics)
            exit, unnest, next, nest, link, jump, (inner interpreter) 
            compile, find, token, skip, scan, getline, (outer interpreter)
            _getchar_, _putchar_ (depends on system)
```

### Coding for minimal size, not for best performance. Using ca65 V2.19 - Git 7979f8a41.

_19/12/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 692 bytes, include key and emit, clean rts.

_05/12/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 588 bytes, with ascii-7 and aritmetic shift right (2/).

_27/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 572 bytes, clear some errors and include ascii-7 checks

_22/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 566 bytes, more good tips from Peter Ferrie <peter.ferrie@gmail.com>

_20/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 590 bytes, some good tips from Peter Ferrie <peter.ferrie@gmail.com>

_20/11/2023_ rebuild the github repo without fork from original milliForth[^1]

_16/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 555 bytes. (wrong count !!!! )

_14/11/2023_ code for 6502 sized to 624 bytes.

## Language

_"SectorFORTH was an extensive guide throughout the process of implementing milliFORTH, and milliFORTH's design actually converged on sectorFORTH unintentionally in a few areas. That said, the language implemented is intentionally very similar, being the 'minimal FORTH'."_

For Forth language primer see [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/)

The milliForth for 6502 have some changes:

- Does not use _hardware stack_ as Forth stack;
- Only _IMMEDIATE_ flag used;
- Only update _latest_ at end of word definition, so the word is hidden while defined;
- Uses _Minimal Thread Indirect Code_ as inner dispatcher[^4];
- sizes of _tib, data stack, return stack_ are 256 bytes [^5];
- uses 32 bytes of _page zero_;
- depends on spaces before and after a word in tib;
- uses 7-bit ASCII characters;
- still no include a classic _'OK '_;
- still no include a destructive backspace routine; 

## Use

_** Still not operational, using lib6502 for emulation and tests, Any sugestions ? **_

A crude small script for compile with ca65 is included.

    ; for make it
    sh mk a sector-6502

    ; for clear it
    sh mk x sector-6502

the size is take from main: to ends: using the sector-6502.lbl file

## Note

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliFort[^1]
